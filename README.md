# Guessing Game

The aim of this program is to guess the correct answer from a range of 1 - 5. The program would continue looping till the user guesses the correct number.

## Getting Started

To start make sure you have `rust` and `cargo` installed. You can confirm this by running the following commands:

```bash
rustc --version
cargo --version
```

After yiu have confirmed this, use this command to install the crates (dependencies) used for the project: `cargo build`.

After installing the crates, run the program with the command `cargo run` and enjoy the game :)
